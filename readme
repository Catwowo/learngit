We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
See you make your way through the crowd
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes
Oh oh
Oh oh
